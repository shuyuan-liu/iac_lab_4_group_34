This is group 34's code for Imperial College London's 2nd year EIE IAC lab 4: a simplified RISC-V implementation with the `addi` and `bne` instructions.

## Challenges Encountered

## Design Decisions

The ALU was designed with only add and subtract as this was enough to implement the `addi` and `bne` instructions. The ALU's control input was reduced to one bit wide.

## Areas for Improvement
